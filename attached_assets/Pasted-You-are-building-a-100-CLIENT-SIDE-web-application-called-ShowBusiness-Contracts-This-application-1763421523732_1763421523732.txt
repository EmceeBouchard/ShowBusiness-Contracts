You are building a 100% CLIENT-SIDE web application called ShowBusiness: Contracts. This application must run entirely in the browser with ZERO backend services, ZERO API calls, and ZERO external dependencies for contract analysis.

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application only
- NO server-side code
- NO API calls to Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, or any AI service
- NO database or backend storage
- Contract analysis must use pure JavaScript pattern matching and regex
- All storage uses browser LocalStorage API only

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript (or React if preferred)
- PDF parsing: PDF.js library (client-side)
- OCR for photos: Tesseract.js (client-side)
- Text analysis: Custom JavaScript functions using regex and keyword matching
- Storage: Browser LocalStorage API
- Deployment target: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)

CONTRACT ANALYSIS ENGINE:
Build a JavaScript-based pattern matching system that:
1. Takes contract text as input (from paste, PDF, or OCR)
2. Searches for specific keywords and phrases from the THREAT_MATRIX
3. Uses regex patterns to identify dangerous clauses
4. Assigns severity ratings (Green/Yellow/Red) based on matches
5. Returns analysis results as JSON

Example threat detection pattern:
```javascript
const threats = {
  PERPETUAL_IRREVOCABLE: {
    keywords: ['perpetual', 'irrevocable', 'in perpetuity'],
    severity: 'RED',
    analysis: 'This gives them your rights forever...'
  }
}

DO NOT:
	•	Import any AI/ML libraries
	•	Make any fetch() calls to external APIs
	•	Require authentication or API keys
	•	Use Node.js backend code
	•	Connect to any database
DO:
	•	Use only client-side JavaScript
	•	Store data in browser LocalStorage
	•	Process all text locally
	•	Make it deployable as static files
Build this application following the visual identity and workflow stages from the original prompt, but implement ALL analysis logic as pure JavaScript pattern matching.
